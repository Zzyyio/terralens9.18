          TerraLens is a free classroom studio. There is no login, no paywall, no advertising, and no
          sponsorship banner. We do not keep student work, scores, or class lists.

        <p>
          Lab state (tilt, date, viscosity, labels) lives in the page URL and in this browser only. Copy the
          link to share a setup. Closing the tab does not send that state to a server.

        <p>We do not track academic behaviour. There is no analytics SDK that scores a pupil’s clicks.</p>

          Hosting may set a Cloudflare bot-management cookie (<code className="font-mono text-sm">__cf_bm</code>
          ). That cookie is for abuse control, not classroom surveillance.

          Maps request tiles from OpenFreeMap / OpenStreetMap and, on the live-weather tool, a forecast from
          Open-Meteo. Those requests carry an IP address to those services. If the tile network fails, the
          atlas falls back to a static Natural Earth coastline we ship with the app.

          Type is self-hosted on this origin (Fraunces, Geist, Geist Mono). A classroom that blocks Google
          Fonts still gets the faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some labs embed a YouTube nocookie film. That request leaves this origin for youtube-nocookie.com
          only when you open the Why panel and the film is on the page. Autoplay is off. There is no YouTube
          account wall.
